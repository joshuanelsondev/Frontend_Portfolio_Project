                    <li>In this game of 21 the player will play against the computer who will also serve as the dealer.</li>
                    <li>Will we be using a standard deck of 52 cards, so no jokers!</li>
                    <li>The Objective is for you, the player, to have your cards amount to 21 or as close as possible without going over.</li>
                    <li>To count the cards each card is assigned a value:
                        <li>Number cards are worth their face value. A 2 is worth 2 points, a 3 is worth 3 points and so on, all the way up to 10.</li>
                        <li>The king, queen, and jack are worth 10 points.</li>
                        <li>The Ace is worth 1 point or 11 points, with the decision being left to the player.</li>
                     </li>
                    <li>The player will be dealt 2 cards that will remain face up while the dealer will have their first card showing and the second one face down.</li>
                    <li>The player will have the option to HIT (draw another card) as long as they are not over 21 points.</li>
                    <li>In this version of 21 the player must HIT if their points are under 17, the same rule goes for the dealer.</li>
                    <li>Once the player decides to pass their turn to the dealer the dealer's face down card will be revealed and they will have the opportunity to draw or not.</li>
                    <li>If the player or dealer have 21 when the cards are dealt then they automatically win.</li>
                    <li>The game results in a tie when both the player and the dealer have 21</li>
                    <li>In the event of the player and dealer having the same score but both being under 21 points, the player must draw another card.</li>
